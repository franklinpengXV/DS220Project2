INCLUDED:
AdmissionPrediction.py - python code
admission.txt - modified admissions files. 
Use Video.mp4 - A video on how to use the program. 

NOTES:
This is version 1. It is very inefficent.

Please make sure to have neo4jrestclient installed 
"pip install neo4jrestclient"

Please delete/ reset database when attempting to create all the relationships.
relationships are created on a set creation basis. So everytime a student and his/ her score nodes are created, 
they are related togheter at the same time. 

After selecting "Yes" to create database, use alt tab to find the file search windows. I don't know why it doesn't
pop up in front of the console window. It's always hidden in the background. 

After uploading everything to the neo4j servers, it will take a couple of minutes for all that data to be organized. 
During this time, it is common for the browser or the app browser to be very laggy and unresponsive. 

The default number of nodes is 300. This will lead to unlinked pairs as parent nodes will be missing.
Changing the number to >= 4005 will display all nodes and all connections. However, keep in mind that it will take some time
for neo4j to visualize all this data. During the time it does so, the program will be very laggy and slow. Give it a good 
couple of minutes before attempting to fullscreen, drag around, zoom in/ out, etc.
